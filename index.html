    <h2><u>Welcome to my personal site!</u></h2>
    <h2> Here is a place where you can easily find much of my works and info about myself as a Visual Effects Artist.</h2>
    <div class ="quickbio"><b>About Me:</b> Since I was 7 years old I have been creating my own movies using myself, objects, and friends and family as characters. Before even that age I would act out scenes from movies I saw in my own house creating my own miniature film sets using household furniture and spaces in my house. 
        Later on when I had began making my own videos and movies I had been using a small picture camera to start with. I would start and stop recording as a form of editing since I didnâ€™t have a computer to trim edit on yet. 
        By age 10 I began to use a desktop Mac to edit my movies. I taught myself most of the editing process in Final Cut Express. Later on I found professionals who helped me learn a few specifics about the software. 
        Ever since I have been directing, acting, filming, editing and compositing my videos and movies. Most of them range about 15 min. I have made a few feature length films over an hour long each. 
        The most recent feature is on my YouTube channel, from which the videos on this site are supplied.
        I enjoy working with editing in special fx such as: compositing, green screen keying, masking, cloning, match-moving, 3D camera tracking and compositing, color corrections, basic editing, sound syncing.
        I also enjoy coming up with detailed stories/plots on the fly. That is how I usually make my shorter 15 minute videos. I use my imagination on a regular basis and that is usually how I generate great ideas for my videos.
