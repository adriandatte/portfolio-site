        <h2><u>Welcome to my personal site!</u></h2>
    
        <div class ="quickbio">
            <b>About Me:</b> Since I was 7 years old, I have been creating 
            movies using myself, objects, and friends and family as characters. 
            Before that age, I would create my own miniature film sets using 
            household furniture and spaces in my house where I would act out 
            scenes from movies. 
            Later on, I began making my own videos and movies using a small 
            picture camera. I would start and stop recording as a form of 
            editing since I didnâ€™t have a computer to trim and edit. 
            By age 10, I began to use a desktop Mac to edit my videos. 
            I taught myself most of the editing process in Final Cut Express. 
            Later on I found professionals who helped me learn a few 
            specifics about the software. 
            Ever since then, I have been directing, acting, filming, 
            editing and compositing my videos and movies. Most of them 
            range about 15-25 minutes. I have made several one-hour+ feature 
            length films.
            The most recent feature film is on my YouTube channel and can 
            also be found on this website.
            I enjoy working with editing in special fx such as: compositing, 
            green screen keying, masking, cloning, match-moving, 3D camera 
            tracking and compositing, color corrections, basic editing, 
            sound syncing.
            I also enjoy coming up with detailed stories/plots on the fly. 
            That is how I usually make my shorter 15 minute videos. 
            I use my imagination on a regular basis and that is usually 
            how I generate great ideas for my videos. 
            Check out my <b><a href="/videos.html" class="blue">Videos page</a></b> 
            to see more of my original work.
